# Snail-Game
Simulates snails crawling in a line, and counts the number of groups that they will create. The random numbers approximate the sum of a harmonic series.


Scenario: On a one-way street, there are n snails crawling in the same direction. Their initial velocities are 1 cm/s, 2 cm/s, ... n cm/s, and there initial positions are random. When the snail in the back catches up to the one in front of it, it will have to slow down and crawl behind the snail in front of it, creating a group. After enough time, we want to know how many groups the snails divided into.

In this program, you can change the values of n, the number of snails, and N, the number of trials. Note that for large values of N, the running time of this program becomes longer.
